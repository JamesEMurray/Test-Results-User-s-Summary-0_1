<h2>User's Summary of The Experience</h2> <n>
<p><h3>Notes From Test - New User:</h3> </p>
<p>1. Success: Attempt 3 - With Minimal Assistance <br>
2. Success: Attempt 1 - Unexpected Method <br>
3. Success: Attempt 2 - Had to Redo Process </p>
<n>
<p>- Pop-up Ads are annoying <br>
- Format attracts the eye down to pictures <br>
- Back arrow on site doesn't do what you would expect <br>
- Random Card button too small <br>
- Layout is intuitive and well thought out in the after-card-selection screen <br>
- Artist's name found before creator's name <br>
- Search Functionality issue -> autocorrects usernames (Makes more awkward), Tags Unclear <br>
- Explore Cards Feature could be better structured <br>
- Lime green does not imply click-ability <br>
- Recent News section is distracting, should be replaced with a way to search for artworks to use <br>
- Can't copy images directly from another site (Have to download and upload <br>
- Adding mana symbols should be doable using drag and drop as well as clicking <br>
- No description as to what certain symbols represent (minor issue) <br>
- Very few obvious pieces of feedback from buttons on the site, with upon mousing over and upon clicking. <br>
- Actual symbols should show up in text box when creating card, not just "U" and the like <br>
- No system feedback for saving cards, No Autosaving <br>
- Create an account button doesn't take you to the create an account screen from multiple pages <br>
- Errors given during account creation are unrelated and unhelpful. Couldn't actually set up an account. <br>
- Have to have an account to save a card - should this be the case? -> Why isn't this made clear earlier in the process. <br>
- Doesn't generate card correctly in preview, aliasing of control characters <br>
- Aliasing present on site when scrolling, light blue lines sometimes appear. <br> </p>

 Image size minimum is far too high. <br>
Ordering system message is not noticeable enough. <br>
Adding mana cost, no issue. <br>
Selection options for Card Category aren't extensive enough. <br>
Card still doesn't load correctly. <br>
Power and Toughness box not clear enough. <br>
Button to make things italicised requires selecting text, which isn't obvious. (Was second guess that it worked this way) <br></p>
<n>
<p>4. Brings you to random page. <br>
Doesn't save card when you Login to Save. <br>
Aliasing persists. <br></p>
